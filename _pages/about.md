Welcome to my page!

I am an economist specializing in applied and theoretical econometrics. My research focuses on leveraging machine learning methods to answer questions and relax assumptions in causal inference particularly when subjects are exposed to network interference. I enjoy working with data, and I am broadly interested in biostatistics, econometrics, statistical machine learning, and statistics education.
